# Fred Rocha's personal corner of the web

![Apres moi le deluge](http://www.fredrocha.net/wp-content/themes/theshinny/img/torrent%20of%20thoughts.jpg)

Source for the website that lives in [fredrocha.net](http://fredrocha.net).

This site hosts different kinds of things that entice me. There is a strong focus on The Word, so the (micro) blogging side of the platform is where the iterations happen more frequently.

The main quote on the homepage reflects what's going on my mind as we speak, so feel free to bookmark it on your browser, keep coming back, set it as default on open. It's either an excerpt of a longer article, a micro-blogpost.

Information also gets dynamically pulled from platforms where I log my art consumption (pun), eg Letterboxd and Goodreads.

## Compiling CSS
Run this on the root of the theme's directory:

`sass --watch library/scss/style.scss:library/css/style.css`

To create a production ready, compressed stylesheet:

`sass library/scss/style.scss:library/css/style.css --style compressed` 


## Features

* Responsive, collapsible header menu
* Memes page features my cultural zeitgeist
* POSSIE to Twitter. Using the black magic of [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) all my posts labeled with the category "Microblog" are automatically posted to Twitter. **Own your data!**


The base of this is Wordpress, and what you'll find in this repo is a custom theme based on the minimal and lightweight *Bones*.

## What is Bones
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme__

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
