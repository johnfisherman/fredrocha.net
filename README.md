This site hosts different kinds of things that entice me. There is a strong focus on The Word, so the (micro) blogging side of the platform is where the iterations happen more frequently.

## Features

* Responsive, collapsible header menu
* Mosaic home page, where each entry automatically falls into one place of the viewport of the page. Courtesy of [Pakery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/index.html).
* Memes page features my cultural zeitgeist, feeding from 3 APIs:
	* Last.fm (for music) :musical_note:
	* Goodreads.com (for books) :books:
	* Criticker.com (for movies) :movie_camera:
* POSSIE to Twitter. Using the black magic of [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) all my posts labeled with the category "Tweets" are automatically posted to Twitter. Own your data!


The base of this is Wordpress, and what you'll find in this repo is a custom theme based on the minimal and lightweight *Bones*.

## What is Bones
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme__

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
