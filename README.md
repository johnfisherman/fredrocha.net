# Fred Rocha's personal corner of the web

Source for the website that lives in [fredrocha.net](http://fredrocha.net).

This site hosts different kinds of things that entice me. There is a strong focus on The Word, so the (micro) blogging side of the platform is where the iterations happen more frequently.

The base of this is Wordpress, and what you'll find in this repo is a custom theme based on the minimal and lightweight *Bones*.

# What is Bones
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme__

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
